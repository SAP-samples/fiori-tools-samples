# KM PR Checklist - Pre-Review Validation

## Overview
This checklist ensures documentation changes meet KM standards before review, reducing review cycles and maintaining quality consistency. Follow this checklist for all documentation PRs.

## Automated Validation

### Run docs-linter Tool
Before creating your PR, run the automated checks:

```bash
# Basic check with auto-fix for safe issues
docs-linter check README.md --auto-fix-safe

# Comprehensive analysis
docs-linter check README.md --comprehensive

# Validate against KM standards
docs-linter validate README.md --km-standards
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ No errors (red ❌ items)
- ✅ Minimal warnings (yellow ⚠️ items)
- ✅ Quality score ≥ 75/100 for substantial documentation
