Support, Chat and samples, please refer to [https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/)

## Description

The SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) is a framework of languages, libraries, and tools for building enterprise-grade services and applications. It guides developers along a ‘golden path’ of proven best practices and a great wealth of out-of-the-box solutions to recurring tasks.

This repository provides sample CAP projects using different router configurations and the steps required to deploy to Cloud Foundry;

1. [Managed Approuter](/cap-fiori-mta/README.md) with SAP Hana Cloud service

2. [Standalone Approuter](/cap-fiori-mta-standalone/README.md) with an inmemory database

Both CAP project were generated using the steps outlined in this [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/10/build-and-deploy-a-cap-project-node.js-api-with-a-sap-fiori-elements-ui-and-a-managed-approuter-configuration/) selecting the appropiate approuter configuration as the HTML5 application runtime.
