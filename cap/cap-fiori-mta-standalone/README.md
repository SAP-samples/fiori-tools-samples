# Getting Started
Build and deploy a CAP Project API with a Fiori Elements UI and a standalone approuter configuration hosted on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) using an inmemory database.

The CAP project was generated using the steps outlined in this [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/10/build-and-deploy-a-cap-project-node.js-api-with-a-sap-fiori-elements-ui-and-a-managed-approuter-configuration/) using the `Standalone Approuter` configuration as the HTML5 application runtime. 

## Prerequisites
These are only required if deploying to Cloud Foundry (CF)
- Youâ€™ll need an SAP Cloud Platform [account](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/)
- You are subscribed to the [Launchpad Service](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-portal-cloud-foundry-getting-started.html)
- The API Endpoint i.e. `https://api.cf.us10-001.hana.ondemand.com` which can be found in your subaccount overview page as this needs to be appended to `oauth2-configuration` in your `xs-security.json` configuration

### Running on SAP Business Application Studio (SBAS)
- Create a [dev workspace](https://help.sap.com/viewer/c2b99f19e9264c4d9ae9221b22f6f589/2021_3_QRC/en-US/f728966223894cc28be3ca2ee60ee784.html) using a `SAP Fiori` or `Full Stack Cloud Application`

## Setup and Run Locally
- Open a terminal window and run `npm ci`
- Run `cds watch` to build and start your application
- Select `Open in New Tab` when prompted, a new browser tab should open
- Select your Fiori web application or select the `Books` service endpoint

## Build and Deploy to CF
Option 1 - Using [Cloud MTA Build Tool](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-mta-build-tool)
- Ensure the `xs-security.json` is updated with the correct `oauth2-configuration` API region settings
- Right-click `mta.yaml` and select `Build MTA Project`
- Right-click `mta_archives -> standaloneCAPProject_1.0.0.mtar` and select `Deploy MTA Archive`
- This will prompt you for your CF details if you are not already logged in
- Your CAP Project will be successfully deployed to CF

Option 2 - Using cli
- Ensure the `xs-security.json` is updated with the correct `oauth2-configuration` API region settings
- Run the following command;
```shell
npm run build && npm run deploy
```
- This will prompt you for your CF details if you are not already logged in
- Your CAP Project will be successfully deployed to CF, select the second generated application URL for example, `<subdomain>-<space>-standalonecapproject-approuter.cfapps.<api-region>.hana.ondemand.com`

## Verify Deployment
- Option 1 - Open a new terminal window and run the following command, selecting the second URL generated under the `urls` column;
```shell
cf mta standaloneCAPProject
```
- Option 2 - Using SAP BTP Cockpit, login to your SAP BTP subaccount, select Overview, select Spaces, choosing the space where the application was deployed to, select the name of your deployed approuter, for example `standalonecapproject-approuter`. This will display the application routes to your Fiori UI application.

## Undeploy
No longer want your CAP project hosted on SAP BTP, run the following command;
```shell
npm run undeploy
```

## Known Issues
To support connectivity to on-premise systems, please uncomment the code in the `mta.yaml` enable the `standaloneCAPProject-connectivity` service.
