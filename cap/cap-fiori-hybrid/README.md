# Get Started with SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) using Fiori tools and Managed Approuter with Hybrid Profile

Build and deploy a CAP Project API with a Fiori Elements UI to Cloud Foundry (CF) using a managed approuter configuration hosted on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) using [SAP CAP hybrid profile](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/hybrid-testing) for testing and development.

The CAP project was generated using the steps outlined in this [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/10/build-and-deploy-a-cap-project-node.js-api-with-a-sap-fiori-elements-ui-and-a-managed-approuter-configuration/) using the `Managed Approuter` configuration as the HTML5 application runtime.

One of the main reasons for this repository is to showcase how a CAP project with a Fiori UI can be developed and tested using a `production-near` environment. The SAP CAP hybrid approach will allow the developer to;

* Work with a HANA HDI database instance 
* Leverage real user authentication

The benefit? You can switch between local mock configuration and cloud service configuration by simply setting or omitting the hybrid profile parameter.

## Prerequisites
- You have created a [SAP Cloud Platform trial account](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/)
- You are subscribed to the [Launchpad Service](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-portal-cloud-foundry-getting-started.html)
- Create an [SAP HANA Cloud Service instance](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-app-hana-cloud-setup.html#08480ec0-ac70-4d47-a759-dc5cb0eb1d58) and the service instance is running
- Create a [dev workspace](https://help.sap.com/viewer/c2b99f19e9264c4d9ae9221b22f6f589/2021_3_QRC/en-US/f728966223894cc28be3ca2ee60ee784.html) using a `Full Stack Cloud Application`

## Setup and Run Locally

- Git clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples.git`
- Change into the CAP hybrid project `cd fiori-tools-samples/cap/cap-fiori-hybrid`
- Login to your CF environment, `View` -> `Command Palette` -> `CF: Login to Cloud Foundry`
- Right-click your CAP project and select `Open in integrated terminal`
- Install the required dependencies `npm run install:app`
- Build the CAP and Fiori UI applications `npm run build`
- Deploy the CAP and Fiori UI applications `npm run deploy`

__CAP project is configured with security roles, any changes made locally need to be reflected both locally and remotely__

- Update the XSUAA security service `npm run cf:uaa:update`

__Ensure the security roles defined in `xs-security.json` are assigned to your user__

- [Set up the roles](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/authentication#auth-in-cockpit) for your application 

__Push some data to HANA__

The CAP project was created with samples, edit the csv file in the `data` folder

- Run `npm run deploy:hana`

__At this point, you have deployed your application to CF, if you run the CAP project locally using `npm run start` it will spin up the project using an in-memory database instance. Deployment has to occur first for the remaining steps to work as this will leverage the deployed HANA and UAA service instances__

- Bind to the XSUAA service `cds bind -2 managedAppCAPProject-xsuaa-service --kind xsuaa`
- Bind to the HANA HDI service `cds bind -2 managedAppCAPProject-db`
- Spin up your CAP project in hybrid mode `npm run watch:hybrid` but don't click the `Open in a New Tab` prompt since this is not authenticating the user with XSUAA security
- The console output will show HANA connectivity;

```
[cds] - connect using bindings from: { registry: '~/.cds-services.json' }
[cds] - connect to db > hana {
```

__To imitate a `production-near` environment, you need to route the HTTP requests to your SAP BTP XSUAA and HANA services. The `localrouter` will fetch a valid token from the XSUAA instance and attach it to every subsequent request.__

- Install the local approuter `npm run install:localrouter`
- Spin up the local approuter `cds bind --exec -- npm start --prefix localrouter`
- Open your CAP Project using the `localrouter:5001` endpoint, `View` -> `Ports: Preview` -> select port 5001
- Open the new browser tab and select your Fiori UI application

## Gotchas

### Forbidden

You have tried to load your Fiori UI application on port 5001 but get the following error message;
```
Application could not be started due to technical issues.
Forbidden
```

Please ensure you have assigned your email address to the `capuser` role in your SAP BTP cockpit under security, follow [this guide](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/authentication#auth-in-cockpit) for steps.
